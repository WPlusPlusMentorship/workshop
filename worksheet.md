# W++ Workshop Worksheet

## Phases of the Journey

Just like how software is iterated upon via refactors, new features, and bug fixes, your career is a series of phases repeated over and over again. Continual improvement.

There are four phases:

* Phase 1: Hitting a wall
* Phase 2: Resourcing & analysis
* Phase 3: Actionable next steps
* Phase 4: Iteration & execution

Use the **Reflection** section in each phase to write out what things in your journey relate to that phase. Your peers will read this, ask questions, and give feedback.

Use the **Notes** section to take notes in the discussion you have with your peers.

## Phase 1: Hitting a wall
You find yourself lacking something. You know what you want to achieve, and you’re hitting a wall.

**Phase 1** is characterized by:

* Frustration - "I know I'm capable, so why can't I figure this out?"
* Self-doubt - "I am having a high level of anxiety that I'm just not good enough"
* Being forced to settle - "I have to accept conditions that really bother me. I am in this never-ending loop of trying to accept, but then eventually not being able to accept it."
* Lacking resources - "I’m willing to do the work but I don’t know how to approach this effectively"

### Reflection
I kind of relate to this because I feel like I have to be really intentional and verbose with my technical design work whereas other coworkers seem to just 1, 2, click concepts. I know I'm still in-training with technical design work and I'm comparing myself to people who have multiple years of experience over me, but I sometimes can't shake the insecurity. I struggle to control my anxiety when I don't have all the answers or can't totally explain my reasoning for my technical design work. I am also nervous about next steps; I've decided to pursue getting my AWS Certification as a way to give myself some accountability and structured learning, but I am definitely worried about my own bandwidth. I feel I already struggle with work-life balance, and I am not willing to give up other parts of my life for my work, so I just really need to figure it out.

### Notes

## Phase 2: Resourcing & Analysis
Pouring yourself into resourcing and figuring out what you need to advance

**Phase 2** is characterized by:

* Self-inventory - Journal, fill out a career worksheet, document your journey thus far
* Consulting experts - Read books, articles, podcasts, blogs, research papers
* Find your people - Talk to people in your community, your family, mentors, friends, peers
* Analyzing the reality - Identify the limitations of your environment and how you can subtract, add, or modify to it

### Reflection
I've honestly not read a whole lot about my problem with technical design work. I have a career worksheet, and I see that I am improving at technical design. I've engaged with my manager and the VP of Engineering to support my goals. I also have a good technical mentor who I can check in with as a coworker, so that's a good support system. I don't have a community that's fighting this same exact battle, so I probably could find one. I think the limitations are really finding the time that I can realistically to tackle this AWS Certification. I also think I need to as much as possible, stop comparing myself to people who have years of experience on me, because that is tearing me down.

### Notes

## Phase 3: Actionable Next Steps
The output of Step 2. Actionable short-term steps towards a long-term goal

**Phase 3** is characterized by:

* Immediate changes - Documenting all 1:1s, speaking up once in every meeting, scheduling 1:1s, spending 2 hours studying each week
* Finding opportunities - Look ahead at your calendar and schedule time to prepare
* Beefing up your network - Make allies, champions, sponsors in your environment
* Committing mentally - No pain, no gain. Commit to the short-term struggle

### Reflection

1. Commit mentally to belief in myself and my ability to figure it out.
2. Commit mentally to not comparing myself to others and to ask questions when I am lost.
3. Commit mentally to allowing myself to not know the answers.
4. Fill out my mindset map and use it to hold myself accountable to having balance in my life.
5. I can do some searching to see if there's a community/cohort that's studying for their AWS certification

### Notes


## Phase 4: Iteration & Execution
Be fearless and know that you have a collective behind you. Fail fast, make quick changes, try again.

**Phase 4** is characterized by:

* Lessen the failure feels - Failure hurts, but as you go through this cycle over and over, it becomes a normal part of the journey
* Self-empathy - Failing after so much work to prepare can make you feel like you’re in Step 1 again
* Take the lessons - Figure out how your failure fits into your model of working, take the lessons, and try again
* Re-commit mentally - No pain, no gain. Commit to the short-term struggle
