# W++ Workshop Worksheet

## Phases of the Journey

Just like how software is iterated upon via refactors, new features, and bug fixes, your career is a series of phases repeated over and over again. Continual improvement.

There are four phases:

* Phase 1: Hitting a wall
* Phase 2: Resourcing & analysis
* Phase 3: Actionable next steps
* Phase 4: Iteration & execution

Use the **Reflection** section in each phase to write out what things in your journey relate to that phase. Your peers will read this, ask questions, and give feedback.

Use the **Notes** section to take notes in the discussion you have with your peers.

## Phase 1: Hitting a wall
You find yourself lacking something. You know what you want to achieve, and you’re hitting a wall.

**Phase 1** is characterized by:

* Frustration - "I know I'm capable, so why can't I figure this out?"
* Self-doubt - "I am having a high level of anxiety that I'm just not good enough"
* Being forced to settle - "I have to accept conditions that really bother me. I am in this never-ending loop of trying accept, but then eventually not being able to accept it."
* Lacking resources - "I’m willing to do the work but I don’t know how to approach this effectively"

## Phase 2: Resourcing & Analysis
Pouring yourself into resourcing and figuring out what you need to advance

**Phase 2** is characterized by:

* Self-inventory - Journal, fill out a career worksheet, document your journey thus far
* Consulting experts - Read books, articles, podcasts, blogs, research papers
* Find your people - Talk to people in your community, your family, mentors, friends, peers
* Analyzing the reality - Identify the limitations of your environment and how you can subtract, add, or modify to it

## Phase 3: Actionable Next Steps
The output of Step 2. Actionable short-term steps towards a long-term goal

**Phase 3** is characterized by:

* Immediate changes - Documenting all 1:1s, speaking up once in every meeting, scheduling 1:1s, spending 2 hours studying each week
* Finding opportunities - Look ahead at your calendar and schedule time to prepare
* Beefing up your network - Make allies, champions, sponsors in your environment
* Committing mentally - No pain, no gain. Commit to the short-term struggle

## Phase 4: Iteration & Execution
Be fearless and know that you have a collective behind you. Fail fast, make quick changes, try again.

**Phase 4** is characterized by:

* Lessen the failure feels - Failure hurts, but as you go through this cycle over and over, it becomes a normal part of the journey
* Self-empathy - Failing after so much work to prepare can make you feel like you’re in Step 1 again
* Take the lessons - Figure out how your failure fits into your model of working, take the lessons, and try again
* Re-commit mentally - No pain, no gain. Commit to the short-term struggle
